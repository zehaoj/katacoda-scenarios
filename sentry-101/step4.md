# Usage

## Capturing Errors & Messages
The reporting of an event is called *capturing*. When an event is captured, itâ€™s sent to Sentry. 

The most common form of capturing is to capture errors. In general, if you have something that looks like an exception, it can be captured.


```
from sentry_sdk import capture_exception

try:
    a_potentially_failing_function()
except Exception as e:
    # Alternatively the argument can be omitted
    capture_exception(e)
    
a_potentially_failing_function():
	print(int('e'))
```


```
from sentry_sdk import capture_message

capture_message('Something went wrong')
```
